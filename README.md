WEEK 1:
I am taking WEB250 because it is the last class I need to get my Web Development AAS. I have studied various degrees over the last 12 years of my life, but have never finished any due to school related depresssion. However, I am determined to finish something.

I currently work at Palatine Library in their Technology department. My primary responsibility is running their makerspace, but I've also been a webmaster for as long as I've worked there. I enjoy working with websites from a front-end perspective, and I'm looking forward to learning about it from a back-end perspective.

WEEK 2:
The thing I learned the most this week is that I still have a lot to learn about server-side scripting. Breaking files into smaller, usable pieces of code was not too bad, and I can see how it would be useful for all areas of coding. However, I was unable to get requests working, and I'm still not sure what I did wrong. AWS went much smoother this week, but I am still curious about how we are supposed to be using it. The wikiversity last week said to close it after running it, but shouldn't it be left open for grading? I've also come to the conclusion that I need to dive deeper into Flask, as I can look up bits of it to use, but the syntax isn't familiar to me yet.

WEEK 3:
This was the first week I didn't feel completely out of my depth. I spent a bunch of time fiddling with the code to get things to work properly, but I understood a bit more what we were doing this week. It was fun working with math and getting everthing to calculate properly. I did some research on GET/POST requests, and it seems to be the consensus that when not working with sensitive data, GET requests are preferred, so I used those in my code this week. I also moved my folder structure around this week so I don't have repetitive code from week to week.
