I am taking WEB250 because it is the last class I need to get my Web Development AAS. I have studied various degrees over the last 12 years of my life, but have never finished any due to school related depresssion. However, I am determined to finish something.

I currently work at Palatine Library in their Technology department. My primary responsibility is running their makerspace, but I've also been a webmaster for as long as I've worked there. I enjoy working with websites from a front-end perspective, and I'm looking forward to learning about it from a back-end perspective.
